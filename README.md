# Overall Goal 
Find a metric for measuring human happiness, a Gross National Happiness (GNH).  The term was coined by the then king of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuck.

Throughout our project we hope to explore several options for measuring this Index, such as Genuine Progress Indicator, Human Development Index, UK's Well Being Measurements, and the City of Santa Monica's [Wellbeing Project}(https://github.com/CityofSantaMonica/WellbeingData)

## This Project : GNHUSA Interview Processing

This specific project hopes to process a set of over several thousand interviews conducted by Vermont-based GNH-USA.
